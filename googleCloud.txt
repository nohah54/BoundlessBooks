We attempted to use google Clound Run to deploy the web app in a containerized environment and connecting the domain name using Regional external Application Load Balancer. 
However, when you enter the authoritative name servers for Cloud DNS in the name servers section of Google Domains, it can take from 48 to 72 hours to propagate.
We also tried to use a virtual machine instance to run a basic Apache web server, but the hosting was taking to long to properly connect given the time constraints.
