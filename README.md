#EndCensorship
TigerHacks 2023 Project: Using Three.JS to create an interactive art instillation that visualizes 3D models of books being thrown into the void. 
The books are tied to PEN America's Index of School Book Bans and each book represents an official ban in a library or class room. 
This webapp is media itself, designed to communicate ideas about free speech and censorship concerning one of the oldest forms of media.
The notifications are clickable so users can get access to censorsed perspectives.

To deploy the application, download the files and open the folder in your choice of code editor (we used VS Code).
1. In the terminal, run "npx vite" and in Chrome, paste the URL "http://localhost:5173/" (or whatever shows in the npx vite terminal)
2. You're done! Watch the animation play, with books being thrown into the void.
